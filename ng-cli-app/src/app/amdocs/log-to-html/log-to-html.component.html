  
Enjoyed using this tool. As I know how many tiring hours I had spent on scanning logs.
#Server Running text indicator
  ServerRunning = Server started in RUNNING mode
  
  #List of Exceptions
  Exceptions = amdocs.csm3g.exceptions.CMException,amdocs.epi.datamanager.ConnectorException,amdocs.epi.datamanager.ObjectNotFoundException,
  
  #List of Request and Response
  RequestResponse = IServiceabilityServicesCheckServiceabilityInputs,IServiceabilityServicesCheckServiceabilityResults,
  
  #Logs text which you don't want to see
  Garbage = Refreshing the logical date,Logical date retrieved
  
  #To fetch detials of step and order action, splitting log with '|', now need column id as it varies log to log (Id start with 0)
  Step.time = 2
  Step.step = 6
  Step.orderAction = 7
  Step.activity = 8
  

Attached zip file contains
