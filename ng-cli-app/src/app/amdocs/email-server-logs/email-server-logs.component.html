              <li>Front end is written in JSF(javax.faces 2.2.0[Mojarra]) with jsf/html(jsf specific html like h:selectManyListbox) jsf/core(jsf tags f:selectItems) jstl/core(for looping c:forEach) tags</li>
              <li>Apache Tomcat 8.5 is used as web and application server</li>
              <li>As part of JSF, Managed Bean is used for information back and forth(Session Scoped) information exchange</li>
              <li>Bean communicates with backend service(bService) for all computation and DB related activity</li>
              <li>Machine where this application is deployed doesn't have direct communication with DB and other server so tunnel(?MyTunnel) has been setup for it</li>
              <li>This tool is split into 3 applications as 2 hops are required</li>
              <li>Connection to another server is achieved with JSCH library for performing SSH</li>
              <li>Using CLI on server standalone application is launched </li>

            <ul>This program has two modes so explaining them seperately, along with common logic. This runs in 1st application.
              <li>Order Mode
                <ul>
                  <li>User provide order id</li>
                  <li>Using this id table is queried to find what stage order is in</li>
                  <li>For that stage request is identifed</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Stage Mode
                <ul>
                  <li>Provided stage id is unique among order as well so as input nothing more is expected from user</li>
                  <li>User will provide request in which is required to be emailed</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Using stage id information of server and host is identifed.</li>
                  <li>Few validations before moving to next step</li>
                  <li>SSH connection is made to target server using JSCH where 2nd application resides</li>
                  <li>2nd application is launched with required input as argument</li>
                  <li>2nd application contact final server using same SSH technology</li>
                  <li>3rd standalone application on final server is launched with required input as argument</li>
                  <li>3rd application search for logs where required stage information exist</li>
                  <li>log is parsed to extract request in which user is interested in</li>
