            <li>Front end is written in JSF(javax.faces 2.2.0[Mojarra]) with jsf/html(jsf specific html like h:selectManyListbox) jsf/core(jsf tags f:selectItems) jstl/core(for looping c:forEach) tags</li>
            <li>Apache Tomcat 8.5 is used as web and application server</li>
            <li>Google chart is used to display charts</li>
            <li>As part of JSF Managed Bean is used for information back and forth(Session Scoped) information exchange</li>
            <li>Bean communicates with backend service(bService) for all computation and DB related activity</li>
            <li>Machine where this application is deployed doesn't have direct communication with DB so tunnel has been setup for it</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Every 15min Fallout information is stored in table with all characterstic required like type, activity etc.</li>
            <li>When page is requested then bean get initialized at same time call to bService goes which pull information with default values</li>
            <li>Default value is also represented as Simple Mode. For quick view of all activity information.</li>
            <li>If you want to dig deep then switch to detailed view which pull information per activity </li>
            <li>Since every call to DB is time consuming hence all information is cached in bService. Whenver session timeout then cache get deleted along with bean.</li>
            <li>Upon selecting an activity javascript method get triger which show graph only for selected activity</li>
            <li>If you change time interval then calls goes to bean which picks up the data from bService and format it according to selected time interval.</li>
            <li>Bean provide data required for graph along with activity information, filter information, time interval</li>
            <li>You can put filtration criteria on graph based on categories. For e.g. you can to see graph only for sepcific type.</li>
            <li>You can also view graph for all variants of a category using "All filter options"</li>
