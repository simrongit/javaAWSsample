    This is the most cherished tool from this set. I was given a manual boring task as part of monthly rotation in team.
    Felt like I can't do this. Task was to let team know about their <span title="
    Merge task - During development phase you save your work in a repository. 
    Your peer work will depend upon that so they need to take it and add it in their work.
    'Take' is known as pull, 'Save' is known as check-in, 'Add' is known as merge, 'Work' is known as task.
    There were two release running in parallel one in development phase another in production phase.
    Development phase people check-in their requirement related task. Production phase people check-in their fixes related task.
    Production phase task is required to be merged with development phase task which is known as merge task."
    style="color:deepskyblue; cursor:help;">merge task</span>.
    If people are organized enough then this work is not required. However fact is for X reasons people don't check-in their merge task.
    These task reviewr doesn't perform review. So all need reminder with their superior in CC to pressusrise them in reassesing their priorities.
    Hence the requirement of this manual effort. Since the day it get created everyone life as saved.
    I took the access of database where Xtra-C store its information. Browsed through table to figure out where is the information which I need.
    Wrote java program which reads data compile it in html send it in email. Email was configured to

        <small>Sep 2016</small>
      </div>
      <p class="mb-1">
        Fetching information from log is common practice either to share information or for easy browsing access on local.
        For order, log tell us in which stage/activity problem exist.
        This adds to effort of finding on which server in cluster that log would be present and finding relevant activity of your order.
        If you have to hop many server just to reach your log then it becomes killer.
        This tool saves all this where user just need to tell what order he is intersted in and rest is taken by the tool.
        Also it is made specific to request/response part as 95% of time we are interested in that information only. 
      </p>
      There are two modes.
      <ul>
        <li>Order Mode : You can provide order action id and it will figure out last stage and send logs for it </li>
        <li>Stage Mode : Provide stage id and select request or enter manually if doesn’t exist. </li>

      <p class="mb-1">
        Performance log have execution time information for many entities. Its a time consuming effort to read log and find impacted area.
        Performance analysis done on local machine generally doesn't help. As DB latency and API performance varies grately in local machine from production.
        Before final performance testing which happens near UAT, we want to do it sooner so that issues can be fixed during development timeitself.
        Development phase is cheapest time to fix performance issue. To reduce manual effort of reading performance log this tool is created.
        It uses ordering stage and phase information to highlight performance issue. 
        Best part is grouping of information which is achieved by html and javascript. 
        And omoting very small value. Which helps in removing lots of cluster.
        On expanding information is shown in tabular form with minimal information. So that analysis of log is matter of second.
        30 rules were created to identify which performance impact can be ignored. Like parent-child relation, 0 value etc.
        Anything deeper then that will require profiler for analysis.
        Plus a bifercation of time spent on DB and API related activity.

          Currently Sonar report generation tool doesn’t create report in below shown format.
          We need this format in order to distribute efforts of fixing errors. Generally we provide a developer set of classes which contain specified Critical/Major errors.

          Beside report generation it also performing filtering part.
          It will consider only those classes which has package starting from “amdocs.oms.cust”
          It will filter out APM auto generated classes. By looking for pattern in class name that is all characters are capital.

          NOTE: It might not cover all the scenario. So suggestion is to take information from the analysis and send it to application team for confirmation. Something in a format like “HF2 exist which is same as HF1 so we should reject HF1, please confirm”. As of now Logic works on Deployed/UnDeployed/Rejected status. May be in future we can use other status in the analysis.
          
          Steps for getting report from AMC.
          Login into AMC
          Click on “Transactions Report”
          Select OMS as application.
          Select date range.
          Save the report
          Open this report
          Remove first two rows.
          While saving it will prompt you to save in another format. Select xls of 97-2003.
          Update the name of report on run.bat
          Click on run.bat
          Analysis excel will be opened.

          In OMS performance logging we print time taken by various methods/APIs/Queries/Services. This tool reads total time taken by a activity and start subtracting time from it those time which are considered as atomic e.g. API calls and DB calls. Whatever the time is left based on it reports whether there is issue or not.
          NOTE: we heavily rely on this logging as analyzing from profiling tool (JProfiler) adds its own computation time while performing calculations. Hence performance logging is much more accurate.

        You need to create MnP in a format so that tool can use it.

          Format standard used is JSON. So you can read in depth about square braces, double quote, commas etc.
          Anything which you see on left side of colon(:) is static. No change allowed
          It starts with what input you need to user. Like I used order_action_id, you can give any name.
          Its recommended to write MnP in lower case in order to avoid accidental string match between query and replaced input parameter
          Then you write select query to validate input.
          Same is bound with user friendly message which you want to show to user.
          NOTE : from select query only 1 row is expected. Select items can only be String.
          Area defines in which DB query is supposed to execute.
        Let me know if you have any question.

        Proposed enhancements
          Use connection pool, it will result in better user experience as it will feel fast.
          Make it smart. 
            50 %, Take only OA id as input thus minimizing input from user.
            70%, Based on form id and error of order action it will decide what all MnPs can be applied.
            95%, It will decide MnP and run it. If none found then it will report.
          Extract connection management to file. Will bring flexibility of addition of when MnP require interaction with other application.
          Auto tracking information creation. It will reduce effort of MnP developer as it he/she won’t have to write tracking sql. Also result in better consistent tracking information.
          Addition of resend tool. For immediate movement of order.
          Addition of cancelation tool. For support of cancelation via OMS API.
          Detail page creation, it will be used for case when no MnP is applicable so that people can find anomalies faster.
            OMS information.
            OMS and CM reconciled information.
            Error check information.
          Tool limitation removal
            Only 1 row will be picked from select query
            Only String input is required from select query
